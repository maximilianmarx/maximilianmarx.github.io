I'm currently studying Software Engineering (B.Sc.) at the THM (Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen University of Applied Sciences) and StudiumPlus in the 5th semester.
The colloquium is at the beginning of 2022.

Throughout the degree program the students learn the skills necessary to analyze, design and implement complex software systems.

Noteworthy is the combination between theoretical knowledge gained through lectures and practical experience gained through projects done in cooperation with the partner company.
