### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Max, currently working as a Product Manager while studying Software Engineering (B.Sc.). I was always curious about how digital systems work behind the scenes. That's why I started diving deeper into IT Security during my apprenticeship. I started to gain practical experience with Python, C, Assembly & Penetration Testing.
During the day I'm implementing Change Requests for our CRM software. At night I heavily enjoy Red Teaming and researching IT-Security related topics.

ðŸš€ Expertise/Interests
- Penetration Testing (OSCP)
- Active Directory Attacks
- Web App Penetration Testing
- Web Development
- User and Customer Experience (UX/CX)


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
- Penetration testing Active Directory environments
- Working through the Cyber Security pass offered by INE (https://ine.com/pages/cybersecurity)

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
- Anything related to IT Security (Hacking, Penetration Testing, et cetera)
- Cloud, Web Development, Artificial Intelligence
- Customer Experience and Innovation

âš¡ Fun fact: Not only do I love IT Security related offensive attacks and defensive mechanisms, I live and love them in real life through Kickboxing and Krav Maga, too!
