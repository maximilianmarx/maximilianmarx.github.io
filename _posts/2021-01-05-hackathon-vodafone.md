Between 29th of March 2019 and 31st of March 2019 Vodafone and CGI hosted a [Hackathon](https://www.de.cgi.com/de/events/hackathon-duesseldorf) in the sector of Advanced Analytics and Digital Communication.

Our team (I and three other friends) won first place in the Hackathon event.
We developed a new, customer-centric incident management concept for Vodafone Germany in order to improve its customer service quality for the enterprise business sector.

We made multiple statistical analysis on big data to visualize KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and identify correlating problems.

Our solution included an AI-powered voice/chatbot, which automates the process of incident ticket creation and also provides customers with assistance for self-service incidents. Last but not least our solution included a ticket dashboard.

There is also an [article](https://www.giessener-anzeiger.de/wirtschaft/wirtschaft-regional/giessener-heavy-metal-hackers-gewinnen-hackathon_20199444) in a local newspaper (written in german) about us attending this Hackathon.
