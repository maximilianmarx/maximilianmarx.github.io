The objective of the project task was the visualization of related objects within the CRM system.
Therefore improving the comprehensibility and overall overview for users. 

Users are able to perceive the for their use case most relevant informations at glance.
They can also ineract with the data visualized.

I started the conceptual planning with a requirements analysis (Requirements-Engineering) in order to cover the most important aspects and characteristics of the prospective implementation.

The rest of the project was evolving around the core processes of Software-Engineering. Including data modelling, implementation and quality assurance.
