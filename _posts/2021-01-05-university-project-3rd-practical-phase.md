The necessity for the project came from the fact that there doesn't exist a consistent way of scheduling meetings within the CRM application. Appointments start by getting created within for example Outlook and then communicated via telephone calls, mails or verbally. Therefore it's cumbersome to schedule an alternative date, if one or more participants are busy on the planned date.

I talked with colleagues from different departments in regards to that problem and surprisingly they often told me that they tend to use schedule planning softare to solve that particular problem.

Since the CRM software doesn't already have such feature, I developed one.

As with the previous project, I too started with requirements engineering. The core of the project consists of the so called *MERN*-Stack:
- MongoDB (the underlying database)
- Express.js (JavaScript framework for the web server)
- React.js (JavaScript framework for the frontend)
- Node.js (backend JavaScript runtime environment)

It was a fun, but also challenging project, since so many components were involved through the MERN-Stack.
