> **Abstract**:
Problems that we purposely ignore will grow bigger and bigger until they overpower us. Do something about it by breaking bigger problems in smaller chunks and tackle them as soon as possible.
Check the end for a children's book recommendation or a YouTube video which explains it (quick and more in-depth).


Today a close friend of mine and I went for a walk around the park. While it was not the purpose for the meeting, my friend told me about the tough times he's currently going through and seemingly insuperable problems.

When we got back from the walk, I sat down and thought about how I usually tackle small and apparently "indomitable" problems. It was weird, because personally, I thought it's clear that if we face problems that are too big to overcome in one go, we divide them into smaller but solvable problems and then tackle those.

This rational thinking has most likely been biased, since I'm currently in a rather stress-free phase. So I tried to loose myself from that attitude and to abstract more.

First, we have to differentiate between two types of problems that might occur:
- The ones that we **can** influence
- The ones that we **cannot** influence

If a problem occures that we cannot influence, then that is both *good* and *bad* (depending on how you view it). It's a mixture of both because if we cannot do anything about it, then we'll just have to wait and see. Nevertheless I'd still regulary check if we can mitigate the outcome to our favor (or if we can prepare in any other way - like mentally).

Interestingly, if on the other hand, a problem occurs that we can influence, then this is also both good and bad. Good because you can change the outcome, bad because you have to do something about it.

We make thousands of decisions every day. This will most likely collapse within a blink of an eye if we do not prioritize continuously throughoutly. Same goes for problems. There are multiple factors to consider when we prioritize. And there is also at least the same amount of tools to rank and categorize problems regarding their priority (most famously the Eisenhower principle). How you prioritize is something you have to decide for your own.

Once you prioritized your controllable problems, you will still face one final dichotomy:
- Problems that are too big to be solved in one go
- Problems that can be solved in one go 

I will come back to the latter in just a second. For the former: Break your problems down into atomic sub-problems. Meaning in so small pieces, that it would not make any sense to break them down further.

Once you have done this, you will "just have to solve them". We're living in a very dynamic world. Multiple ways to get distracted. And biologically probably also multiple things you would rather do. Metaphorically the more you procrastinate, the bigger (even small) problems will get over time - so make a plan and start ASAP.

> There is even a children's book about this "phenomenon" called *There's No Such Thing as a Dragon* (ISBN 0375851372). If you don't want to read it yourself, theres a short [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy18IEayXdc) about it (3:20 minutes) and [**a longer one**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REjUkEj1O_0) (56:37 minutes). You can adapt the speed of the video if you want to.
