## Introduction
Virtual Hacking Labs combines a [**Penetration Testing Courseware**](https://www.virtualhackinglabs.com/?courses=penetration-testing) with a [**Penetration Testing Lab**](https://www.virtualhackinglabs.com/labs/penetration-testing-lab/). 

I started with VHL before I enrolled in PWK in order to get my hands dirty and gain some experience. Before VHL I only did a few machines on Hack The Box. Even though Hack The Box is free to use, it doesn't include course materials to learn Penetration Testing basics.

## Courseware and Lab
The courseware of VHL was around 350 pages long and covered every step normally done in a Penetration Test. It covers everything from Information Gathering to finding and modifying Exploits and finally Privilege Escalation.

When I enrolled the lab had around 40 machines in three categories:
- Beginner
- Advanced
- Advanced+

The machines within the Beginner category usually don't need to escalate privileges after initial compromise and were rather easy. The only real difference between the Advanced and Advanced+ machines is that there are no hints for the Advanced+ machines. Some were more, some less difficult.

I booked the 3 Month Pass, but was done with all machines and Report after one month.

## Summary
Overall I enjoyed the lab and course materials offered by VHL. Unfortunately there is no "real" community behind VHL. But there is one Discord server I'd recommend joining: **VHL**.
